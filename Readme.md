#Joke Generator

- Add an event listener for the button
- Create a function that will make a request to https://api.chucknorris.io/jokes/random using XMLHttpRequest object
- Get the data that is sent back (this.responseText), parse the JSON and get the joke from it
- Display the joke in the page (you can use the innerHTML property)
